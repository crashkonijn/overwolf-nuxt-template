# overwolf-nuxt-template

This is a nuxt template for app development with Overwolf.

The example was build with Apex Legends in mind but it can be changed to any Overwolf compatible game easily.

The pages/desktop.html includes examples of most features.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
